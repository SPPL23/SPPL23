> [!WARNING]
> I'm lazy as *#!$[^1]. 🧐
> [^1]: Unless it's something I'm genuinely interested on.
---
> [!IMPORTANT]

---
> [!NOTE]
> I'm currently using Windows on my desktop.
>
> I have a Toshiba Satellite Laptop that runs Linux, I use **Om-*archy*** *btw* 🤣
> ![Omarchy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzNYxgjaoAAm8Cm.png "Omarchy")
>
> I made this README file because I noticed some repositories that are officially licensed and had a fully designed README section and so I decided to study markdown which I can use for GITHUB and Discord.
---
> [!TIP]
> I don't really have any passion for programming, I'm a laid back person who's chronically attached to PC games, Anime, Manga, Internet Drama, Twitch Streams.
>
> I know how to assemble, disassemble, format, reformat, install Operating Systems like Windows and Linux.
>
>I'm fat 😢
